I'm going to try and keep this short since I planned on not drinking until I finished this speech and a drink is starting to sound pretty good right about now.

All right, so for those of you who don't know me, I'm Mitchell's OLDER brother. There, now you don't have to guess wrong. I know there are some other brothers in year who have felt the pain of being older and having people try and guess and either think that your twins, or GASP that your the younger brother. As long as I can keep this up for the next 30 years I'll get the last laugh Mitchell you just wait. To add insult to injury Mitchell has always been taller than me (I was quite short when I was younger). Thankfully I eventually grew a bit more, but Mitch only let me be both tall and taller than him for about a week. What a week though. I imagine now that your getting married that the age issue will come up more and more, but I've been talking with my therapist and I think I've finally worked through it ;)

On a similar note, I believe I first met Mitchell in the early nineties so we've known each other for about 22, almost 23 years give or take. And in that time we haven't spent more than four months apart in a consecutive period of time. Right from when that little stinker was born we've been glued at the hip. Well, except for that time when we were about two and four and Mitchell left me a little surprise in the tub. It took me a little while to get over that one. Fast forwarding a little bit, me and Mitch have been best friends since before we started drawing beautiful mosaics under grandma aggie's tables in crayon. For some reason grandma didn't appreciate them as much as we did. Throughout school I can honestly say that I've spent more time with Mitchell than anyone else that I've ever met. We always used to spent our entire weekend and most of the weekday after school together sitting downstairs in the living room. We also did lots of after school and summer activities together. In the summer we used to have a tonne of fun on the lake playing in the water and going for hikes on the weekend when we were out on the boat. During the winter season Mitchell was my best skiing and snowboarding buddy. I remember we used to play what was basically a game of tag in the trees when we were snowboarding. Looking back on that now, that was actually pretty dangerous. I also remember we used to try and bribe the ski lift with cookies when it would stop moving. I think it got wise to us eventually because it hasn't worked in a few years. Me and 

 When Mitch proposed to Bethany he gave me a call a few minutes after it happened, and I can still remember the excitement in his voice. I recall though that he was very disappointed to hear my nonchelant reply "okay". So, in order to understand why I wasn't more excited you have to realize that Mitchell had been talking about marrying Bethany for a very long time and I had basically considered it to be a done deal two years ago. So I'm formally apologizing for not being more surprized by the fact that it took you four years to finally propose.
